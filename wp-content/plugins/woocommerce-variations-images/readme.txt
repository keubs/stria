++++ WooCommerce Variations Images ++++

First of all thank you for purchasing this plugin! We hope it will serve you (and your shop's customers) well.


** INSTALLATION

Just upload the WordPress ZIP file from within the WordPress backend or unzip the contents and then FTP to your server into the "/plugins" directory. More information on installing and managing plugins can be found in the WP Codex: https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins

Once activated please head on over to the plugin's settings panel and configure it to your liking.


** GENERAL USAGE

There are two option panels introduced with the WVI plugin:

(1) The submenu-item "WooCommerce Variations Images" in the WooCommerce-settings
(2) The "Display variation images"-box on a per-product basis

You can either activate the variations images by checking "Display variation images for all products" (1) which enables this setting for all products at once (be careful and double-check the output, there might be images missing or something else if not properly configured) or you can navigate to the desired product(s) and enable the variations images there (2) which only activates the new output for the specific product.


** FURTHER OPTIONS

(A) Show Titles
(B) Variations count per row
(C) Variation image size
(D) Variations Template
(E) Custom CSS

(A) If checked the variation title will be output underneath the variation image.

(B) Here you decide how many variations should be shown per row – you can test and tweak accordingly. Since the amount of variations per row will have an effect on how big the variations images are displayed you are advised to you use the lowest image size possible so the impact on your web pages load time is minimized (see C).

(C) The "Variation image size" is based on the image sizes you (or your theme / other plugins) have registered with WordPress. If you want a different image size here then you need to register them accordingly, this is not related to the WVI-plugin... To do so view  https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_image_size

(D) As "Variations Template" you can choose between a table-based or a div-based layout. We encourage you to make use of the table-based layout since it is more compliant and easier to tweak.

(E) The "Custom CSS"-box in the settings panel allows for an easy entry of your CSS-rules without having to edit the themes's stylesheet or similar.
